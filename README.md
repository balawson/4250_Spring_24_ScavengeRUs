# BucHunt
This READ ME document serves as a starting place to begin you Scrum project for SE 1.
  - The documents folder contains UML diagrams outlining the project.
  - The documents folder contains files about the basic file structure, UML diagrams describing how the objects interact with each other.
  - The documents folder also contains the description of the previous team's work.
  - Our team created the series of diagrams in the documentation folder and focused on fixing a couple security bugs.
  - The password reset for admins is partially implemented, most of the backend requirements are still needed.
    - This one may be more than you think, consider slicing it thin to ensure the tasks can fit in the sprint.
  - Bug we found: Too long a header for a hunt cuts off access code sent via sms. This was a bug left over in out product backlog.
