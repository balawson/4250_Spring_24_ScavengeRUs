Team "Index Two" 

Sprint 1

User Story: As an Admin, I should be able to securely reset my password in the event it is lost using a forgot password link.
Acceptance Criteria: Admin is able to use the "forgot password" link on the login page to initiate the password reset/recovery process. Admin should recieve a temporary password via email and is redirected to a page that forces them to set a new password.
Business Value: Ensures that admins can maintain access to their accounts in the event of forgotten/lost passwords.
Result: 

User Story: As an Admin, I should not be able to create a hunt with the same name as an existing hunt.
Acceptance Criteria: Admin is not able to create a hunt with hunt name "x" if hunt name "x" is already the name of a previously created/existing hunt.
Business Value: In reference to the software requirements,"Access codes should be unique". Since the format of an access code is "user-phone-number/hunt-name", ensuring that each hunt has a unique name is the only way to avoid cases where the user has already joined a hunt with that same name before.
Result:
