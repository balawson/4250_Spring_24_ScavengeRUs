Team "Index Two" 

Sprint 1

User Story: As an Admin, I should be able to securely reset my password in the event it is lost using a forgot password link.
Acceptance Criteria: Admin is able to use the "forgot password" link on the login page to initiate the password reset/recovery process. Admin should recieve a temporary password via email and is redirected to a page that forces them to set a new password.
Business Value: Ensures that admins can maintain access to their accounts in the event of forgotten/lost passwords.
Result: No release. Team was able to work on a solution but ran into issues manipulating the user database.

User Story: As an Admin, I should not be able to create a hunt with the same name as an existing hunt.
Acceptance Criteria: Admin is not able to create a hunt with hunt name "x" if hunt name "x" is already the name of a previously created/existing hunt.
Business Value: In reference to the software requirements,"Access codes should be unique". Since the format of an access code is "user-phone-number/hunt-name", ensuring that each hunt has a unique name is the only way to avoid cases where the user has already joined a hunt with that same name before.
Result: No release.

Sprint 2
User Story: As a developer, I should be able to access documentation explaining the code structure and the flow of data so that I can have a better understanding of the application and more effectively use it in the future.
Acceptance Criteria: Understandable documentation/diagrams further explaining the current code structure and the flow of data.
Business Value: Valuable documentation allows developers to gain an deeper understanding of how the application manages data and can be referenced by future developers.
Result: 

User Story: As an Admin, I should not be able to login via access code like a typical non-admin user so that I can maintain exclusive access to my account. 
Acceptance Criteria: Admins accounts are not able to be logged into via access code of hunts they have been a part of.
Business Value: Ensures that access to an admin account remains exclusive to the person that created the account and cannot be easily accessed by anyone else.
Result:
